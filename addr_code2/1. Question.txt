PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
This project aims to generate the three-address Code for a given input, that is recognised using lex as the Lexical Analyser and parsed using yacc (the Parser Generator), while simultaneously performing syntax and semantic analysis. 
The input is essentially a Sub-C language â€“ a subset of the C language, originally developed by Dennis Ritchie.
The Sub-C language for which this project generates 3-address code comprises the following constructs:

DATATYPES: 
Integer (int)
Unsigned Integer(uint)
Boolean (bool)
OPERATORS:
Assignment: 	=, +=, -=, *=, /=
Arithmetic: 		+,  -,  *,  /,  %,  @(Exponentiation)
Bitwise: 		&,  |,  ~,  ^(Exclusive OR )
Logical: 		&&,  ||,  !
Relational: 		==,  !=,   <,  <=,  >,  >=

KEYWORDS:

CONDITIONAL CONSTRUCTS:
 IF 
ELSE
SWITCH
BREAK
CASE
DEFAULT

LOOPING CONSTRUCTS:
WHILE

OTHER TOKENS:       { ,  },  (,  ),  :,  ;
IDENTIFIERS: [A-Za-z]+
NUMERALS: [0-9]+
BOOLEAN LITERALS:  true, false
